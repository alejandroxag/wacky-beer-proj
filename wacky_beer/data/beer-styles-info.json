            "DESC": "Like most amber beers, American amber ale is named after the golden to amber color this American version of English pale ale exhibits. The color is derived from the use of caramel and crystal malt additions, which are roasted to provide amber beers with the color, body and flavor many beer fans have come to appreciate. Falling under the ale beer type, amber ales ferment at warmer temperatures for what is typically a much shorter amount of time than lager style beers. The American amber ale is one of the most\u00a0widely enjoyed styles throughout the United States\u00a0and serves as a cornerstone style of the American craft brewing revolution. American ambers are darker in color than their pale ale cousins, the presence of caramel and crystal malts lending a toasted, toffee flavor, along with the perception of a fuller body when compared to beers without such malts. Amber beer showcases a medium-high to high malt character with medium to low caramel character derived from the use of roasted crystal malts. The American amber is characterized by American-variety hops, which lend the amber ale notes of citrus, fruit and pine to balance the sweetness of the malt. As with many amber beer types, American amber ale is a highly versatile companion to American cuisine, particularly foods that are grilled or barbecued, as roasted malts complement seared, charred and caramelized proteins making this ale beer type a perennial favorite at backyard cookouts. The popularity of the American amber ale makes the style one of the easier amber beers to seek out at small and independent craft breweries or find in a local craft-centric retailer. Across the country, you can discover countless variations of the amber ale. Use our \u201cFind a Brewery\u201d map to help you discover the amber ale beers at a new brewery near you.

            "DESC": "Like many others that have become known as classic American beers, the American pale ale can trace its roots to beer styles from abroad. The American pale ale beer was inspired by the English pale ale, replacing its English counterpart\u2019s earthy, herbal hops with generous additions of boldly citrus and pine-like American varieties. As one of the most popular American beer styles, pale ale beer is not hard to track down, but the various takes on this iconic style by just as many American craft brewers makes it impossible to jam everything there is to know about American pale ale beer on one page, but we\u2019ll do our best. Characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous American hops, the American pale ale is a medium-bodied beer with low to medium caramel, and carries with it a toasted maltiness. American pale ale is one of the most food-friendly styles to enjoy, since the pale ale works wonderfully with lighter fare such as salads and chicken, but can still stand up to a hearty bowl of chili; a variety of different cheeses, including cheddar; seafood, like steamed clams or fish, and even desserts. The American pale ale\u2019s affinity to food can be attributed to the simplicity of its ingredients, which include toasty pale malt, a clean fermenting ale beer yeast, and the counterbalance of American hops to help tease out the flavor or cleanse the palate, preparing you for another bite. While pale ale beer has definitively English roots, many credit the American take on the style to the advent of Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, which employs the use of American Cascade hops and a clean fermenting ale yeast that has become synonymous with today\u2019s West Coast style craft beers. Currently, pale ales offer beer fans a balance between malt and hops, which make pale ales one of the most enjoyed and approachable beer styles available. American pale ale beer remains a staple of the American beer world because it continues to evolve. With each passing day, independent breweries across the country are reimagining the classic pale ale by experimenting with local ingredients to craft flavor profiles that push the boundaries of beer.

As one of the thicker, darker American beers on the craft beer scene, American stout beer is perfect for the colder seasons. Strikingly bold and undeniably beautiful, the American stout beer style blends generous amounts of dark malts with American hops to offer an adventurous experience that is unmatched by other styles of beer. Are you afraid of the dark? When it comes to American stout, don\u2019t be. Allow your senses to run wild with this deceivingly sophisticated take on a European staple. Like many other beer styles that have become prized by American brewers and beer lovers alike, American stout is a distinct variant of a European stout beer counterpart. True to style, American stouts showcase generous quantities of the American hops fans have come to expect, and much like other stout beer types, American stout can be enjoyed year-round but is commonly considered a beer for the fall or winter months. The stout is a terrific companion to bold, hearty foods. Look for hearty game meats, as well as soups and strong cheeses to be particularly suitable for pairing for American stouts, in addition to a variety of after-dinner desserts. Reading about American stout is great, but we encourage you to seek out the style at a local brewery.

The sizable portion of wheat malt used to brew wheat beer lends a lighter, distinctive experience compared to beers brewed with barley exclusively. Typically lighter in appearance, wheat beer can be made using either ale or lager yeast, and American wheat beer can be brewed with at least 30 percent malted wheat. Like the traditional German hefeweizen, these beers are typically served unfiltered\u00a0and can have a cloudy appearance when roused. Traditionally hoppier than its German cousin, American wheat beer differs in that it does not offer flavors of banana or clove, which is indicative of the weizen yeast strain. Nevertheless, the American wheat beer is known worldwide as a refreshing summer style. Malted wheat imparts a distinctively light, flour-like character that differs from all-barley malt beer varieties. American craft brewers were likely inspired by the fruit and spice forward, unfiltered wheat beers of Bavaria. But without access to the specialty Bavarian weizen yeast so critical to the hefeweizen, brewers were forced to use clean fermenting American ale and lager yeast. The American wheat\u2019s composition gives it a particularly inviting style, accepting of additional ingredients, particularly raspberries, watermelon and even chilis. The versatility of wheat beer is a large part as to why it is such a popular craft beer option across the country year-round. Its light character makes it a smooth American beer to pair with lighter foods like salads, shellfish and fresh cheeses.

This brawny, malt-forward beer style is often one of the strongest beer styles on any given beer menu, and showcases a complex melange of toffee and fruit flavors counterbalanced by warming alcohol and sturdy hop bitterness. The barley wine beer style is a sipper, enjoyed responsibly, stylishly \u2014 preferably in front of a fire in a comfy chair amongst a plethora of leather-bound books. Barley wine beer is a strong ale that leans heavily on malt characteristics for flavor. With a wide color range and characteristically high in alcohol content, this is a style that is often aged, as it evolves well over time. As barley wine beers advance in age, they develop oxidative characteristics, including honey and toffee flavors as well as aromas, darker colors, lessened bitterness and more. The origin of the barley wine name brings confusion and its exact origin remains unclear. Strong, wine-strength beers have been around before the name barley wine was first used, but it is often said that barley wine does refer to a wine-strengthened beer. In history, few things are that simple, but regardless of origin, barley wine remains a strong ale with complex malts flavors and sturdy hop bitterness. While no grapes are harmed in the making of this ale, barley wines share wine\u2019s compatibility with food, favoring rich dishes, desserts, the strongest of cheeses and even make for a great after meal digestif. Many craft breweries, microbreweries and brewpubs in the United States brew barley wines for beer lovers to hunt down, and we want to help you find the places to try them. Our \u201cFind a Brewery\u201d map is designed to help you find a location near you to try your first, or next, barley wine beer, and it might be closer to you than you think.

            "DESC": "Few flavors are as universally celebrated as chocolate. From ancient civilizations who drank fermented chocolate to rich, decadent and refined chocolate desserts, the cultural significance of chocolate cannot be understated. Like chocolate, beer too is a celebrated, versatile tradition that spans the globe. American craft brewers have embraced the combination of both with a variety of different approaches and applications to create chocolate flavored beers. While many beers showcase chocolatey flavors without actually having chocolate as an ingredient, chocolate beers use the ingredient itself to offer a uniquely balanced beer experience that can be appreciated by beer connoisseurs and those with sweet tooths alike. Chocolate beer can be an ale or lager that benefits from the addition of any type of chocolate or cocoa. Traditionally added to porters, stouts and brown ales, where the grain bill better complements the confectionery ingredient, it can be added to other styles as well. Chocolate character can range from subtle to overt, but any chocolate beer is generally expected to offer some balance between beer and bon-bon. The style can vary greatly in approach as well as flavor profile depending on the brewer. Known for innovation and pushing boundaries, craft brewers have never met an ingredient they didn\u2019t like, or at least an ingredient they didn\u2019t believe could be expressed in a beer. Chocolate flavored beers offer beer lovers a chance to taste just how versatile craft brewers can be. The use of chocolate in chocolate beers offers yet another example of craft beers culinary compatibility, whether as a pairing or show-stopping course all in itself, a well-crafted chocolate flavored beer is a game changer even for those who don\u2019t generally gravitate towards beer. While stouts and porters are the most complementary styles to embrace the addition of chocolate, chocolate beers need not stick to the script. Chocolate can be added to all types of beer styles, even beers as light as pale ales. The key for any flavored beer is that the ingredients and flavors it presents are balanced well with the base style of beer. Chocolate flavored beer may seem like an odd concept, but any beer or chocolate lover owes it to themself to give chocolate beer a try.

The creations that have resulted from experimenting with the combination of some of the oldest beverages in the world have caught the attention of craft beer lovers everywhere. Coffee beer can be either a lager beer or an ale beer, with coffee added to boost flavor. While stouts and porters are popular base styles for coffee beer, many craft breweries are experimenting with other styles, like cream ales and India pale ales. Brewers may steep the beans in either water or beer to impart java flavor while taking care to avoid the addition of too much acidity. As with any beer, the addition of an ingredient can have a drastic effect on the flavor \u2014 but striking a balance is often the goal of brewers. Coffee is a versatile ingredient in beer, and lends a smooth roasted flavor to just about any style, from stouts and porters to pale ales and even sour beers. You can look to pair coffee flavored beers with a wide variety of different foods. Desserts might be an obvious choice, after all, \u2014 who wouldn\u2019t enjoy a piece of pecan pie cheesecake alongside a smooth, rich coffee oatmeal stout? Despite how well it pairs with sweeter dishes, there is no reason a coffee beer couldn\u2019t be an excellent companion to a charcoal grilled rib-eye steak at your next cookout. This beer style also makes a nice partner when paired with aged semi-hard cheeses when you\u2019re entertaining. Finding your next favorite beer doesn\u2019t have to stop here.

            "DESC": "A bona fide English beer classic, English-style brown ale is easily one of the most iconic beer styles. Toasty, robust and with a bit of chocolate maltiness, the English brown ale is a meal in a glass, but offers unlimited opportunities for memorable food pairings. Neither flashy nor boring, the English brown is a beer with enough variation to keep devotees ordering them time and time again. English-style brown ales have two variations: a dry, roasted version that is said to have originated from northern England, and a sweeter, less attenuated brown ale variety that is believed to have gained favor in the southern portion of England. Both offer a toasted nut, chocolatey character indicative of brown ales. The English brown ale varieties will not be as hoppy or bitter as their American counterparts and favor English hops as well as characterful English ale yeast. Either style can be excellent with a variety of foods, particularly braised meats, but they are perfectly fine to be enjoyed on their own. The alcohol content of this beer is characteristically moderate and does not typically exceed 5.5 percent ABV. It\u2019s safe to say that beer will never go out of style, but with all of the different forms of beer on the craft beer scene, it can be easy for brown ales to get pushed to the side. English-style brown ale is often one of those beers that people look past \u2014 but you should take the opportunity to try this traditional style when you\u2019re at a craft brewery. With relatively low bitterness and two distinct varieties that best complement different pairings, it\u2019s one of the most versatile English beers ever created. Whether you prefer sweeter or more hop-forward ales, there is an English brown ale that\u2019s right for you. If you are in the mood to try one of these classic English brown ale beers, our \u201cFind a Brewery\u201d map can help you do precisely that. By entering your location, any particular state, or the name of a specific brewery, we can point you in the direction of the nearest brewery where you can find your next favorite beer, which could be a variation of an English-style brown ale.

No other style represents modern craft brewing excitement quite like the IPA, and while this English beer differs widely from the American version it inspires, this strong member of the English pale ale family has plenty of its own to offer \u2014 including all of the history behind this variety. Steeped in lore (and extra hops), the English-style IPA is a stronger version of a pale ale. The English-style pale ale is characterized by a hearty helping of English hop character (earthy, floral) and increased alcohol content. English yeast lend a fruity character to the flavor and aroma, offering a contrast to the earthy English hop additions. Different from its American counterpart, this style strikes a balance between malt and hops for a more rounded flavor. There is also a lot of mythology surrounding the creation of this style, which is still debated today. It is most commonly believed that English style pale ale was birthed from the need for a beer that could survive the journey to and from India, a land too warm for beer brewing without the aid of modern technology. The increased alcohol and hop contents would act as preservatives, giving IPAs the qualities that they are known for to this day. In actuality, the beer style that would become popularly known as an India pale ale bears little in common with the contemporary iteration you enjoy today. Additionally, beers similar to what made the trip to India had been in production for domestic consumption prior to any reports of it being exported and records show that other beer styles, including porter, made their way to the English colony of India and were enjoyed by parched soldiers and colonists. English pale ale beers, like the IPA, always offer great beer pairing opportunities. Strong English cheeses as well as grilled or braised meats, like pork, can make very tasty flavor experiences when paired with an English IPA. The higher alcohol, hops and carbonation all work to cut through fat and cleanse the palate, helping every bite be as tasty as the first. As popular as English beers, particularly IPAs, have become among beer lovers, we want to do our part to keep craft beers fans in the loop when it comes to these English beer styles.

The word \u201cdunkel\u201d is German for \u201cdark,\u201d and this dark beer style offers beer lovers balanced flavors of chocolate, bread crust and caramel. The dunkel is a classic German lager that craft brewers are fond of brewing and countless people across the world are fond of enjoying. Like most German beers, dunkel beer is a great candidate for food pairing, matching up well to grilled meats. A German-style dunkel, sometimes referred to as a Munchner dunkel, should have an aroma comprised of chocolate roasted malt and bread or biscuit-like features that stem from the use of Munich malt. Despite the malt forward flavor profile, this beer does not offer an overly sweet impression. Rather, you\u2019ll find a mild balance between the distinct character of malt and the refined touch of bitterness from noble hops, indicative of what many beer drinkers expect from German beer styles. Comprised of mostly Munich malt, the German dunkel\u2019s caramelized malt experience is the product of a chemical process known as the Maillard reaction. This reaction is what lends Munich malt its distinctive bread crust flavor. While barley malt is kilned, the malt browns, creating a myriad of caramelized flavors. Browned proteins, like grilled pork chops and oven-browned bread both benefit from the Maillard reaction. Keep this in mind when you are pairing these types of foods with beers since dishes that showcase flavors derived from the Maillard reaction complement each other very well. These flavors are what make grilled pork chops a great meal to enjoy with a German dunkel beer.

            "DESC": "Arguably one of the most recognizable beer styles, the German-style hefeweizen offers a striking beer experience thanks to the use of distinctive wheat malt, unique yeast and uncharateristic appearance. This wheat beer breaks from the German beer mold, showcasing yeast-driven fruit and spice as well as bearing an eye-catching mystique. Don\u2019t let the cloudy hefeweizen deter you, this beer is one of the world\u2019s most enjoyable styles for beer geeks and neophytes, alike. The refreshing qualities of this highly-carbonated style have kept it alive for centuries. Try one for yourself and experience why that is, firsthand. The German-style hefeweizen is straw to amber in color and brewed with at least 50 percent malted wheat. The aroma and flavor of a weissbier comes largely from the yeast and is decidedly fruity (banana) and phenolic (clove). The intensity of these wildly differing flavor qualities varies depending on the brewer, but the two are most commonly balanced. Hefeweizen typically contains a low to moderate alcohol content\u00a0and is considered to be the most popular amongst the German weissbier variety. In German, \u201chefe\u201d refers to the yeast which remains in suspension giving the German beer its cloudy appearance, and \u201cweizen\u201d denotes the use of wheat. This wheat beer is at its best when poured into a weizen vase, a large curvaceous glass which showcases the beer\u2019s beautiful glow and corrals its large, persistent foam cap given the style\u2019s characteristic effervescence. A German weissbier must showcase the weizen yeast\u2019s one-two punch of fruit and spice to be recognized as a German hefeweizen. The bright fruitiness of banana alongside the pungency of clove allow this beer to work well with a variety of lighter foods, such as salads, seafood and even a variety of egg dishes. German hefeweizen beer, like any other beer, tastes best when freshly poured at a brewery, and we want to help you find the breweries near you that serve the German hefeweizen that you seek. Use our \u201cFind a Brewery\u201d feature to locate breweries based on your location or search for a specific brewery by name. You can even search by state to find a small and independent brewer near you in order to track down your next favorite beer, which could be a German hefeweizen beer.

The helles is a masterclass in restraint, subtly and drinkability which makes it an enduring style for true beer lovers and an elusive style for craft brewers to recreate. The German helles reminds beer lovers that the simple things in life are usually the most rewarding and worth pursuing. \u201cHelles\u201d means \u201cpale in color,\u201d as these beers are often golden. The German-style helles lager is a bit rounder or fuller-bodied than light lager and even all-malt pilsners. Helles lager beers offer a touch of sweetness that balance a measurable addition of spicy German hop flavor and light bitterness. The malt character is soft and bready, making it a terrific complement to light dishes such as salad or fresh shellfish, like clams. Clean and crisp, this is a refreshing beer with substance. Low levels of yeast-produced sulfur aromas and flavors may be common. While the German helles is highly versatile for pairing with food, helles lager is designed for refreshment and makes for the ideal beer on a hot day. Today, small and independent craft brewers offer their own takes on this classic German beer, many following the German tradition exactly, including German malts, spicy German hops and expertly controlled fermentation, offering a balanced yet subtly sweet lager beer. Others have added their own American twist on the helles variety by adding American hops and making this lager beer available in aluminum cans so beer lovers can enjoy this style while out and about. If you have not had the pleasure of tasting and appreciating this beer brewed for beer lovers, do yourself a favor and seek out a brewery near you that offers the style as a taproom option. You won\u2019t be sorry. We\u2019ve assembled an interactive \u201cFind a Brewery\u201d map to help you keep track of all of the breweries and brewpubs near you, and some of those craft breweries are likely making helles beer.

In addition to their thirst quenching ability, they also are a fun beer to enjoy with food, including traditional German sausages and kraut. The German-style Kolsch is light in color and malt character. This style\u2019s fermentation process yields a light, vinous character which is accompanied by a slightly dry, crisp finish. Ale yeast is used for fermentation, though lager yeast is sometimes used in the bottle or final cold-conditioning process. Kolsch beer stems from Cologne (Koln), Germany, but has found its way onto America\u2019s craft beer scene like many other German beers. Technically, for beer to be called a Kolsch, it has to come from the city of Cologne, but that hasn\u2019t stopped American craft brewers from embracing the Kolsch style of beers. Craft beer connoisseurs have been enjoying American Kolsch style beers during the warm seasons since the Kolsch was introduced to the American craft scene.

Pilsner are characteristically light in color and have a very short finish. The world over, pilsner -style lagers have become the standard beer for many reasons, and American craft brewers have worked hard to put their own unique spin on this classic German beer. A classic German-style pilsner is straw to pale in color with a malty sweetness that can be perceived in aroma and flavor. Perception of hop bitterness is medium to high. Noble-type hop aroma and flavor are moderate and quite obvious. Distinctly different from the Bohemian-style pilsner , this style is lighter in color and body and has a lower perceived hop bitterness. German pilsner lagers have a rich history in the United States. Some of the first breweries in the United States were started in the 1800s by German immigrants and specialized in brewing pilsner beer. Since then, American craft brewers have continued to experiment with the classic style pils. Like other German beers, pilsner lager\u2019s crisp finish makes for a refreshing beer during the warmer months of the year.

            "DESC": "If you are one of the 2 million Americans who suffer from celiac disease, trying craft beers may seem impossible, or at least challenging. But with the growing interest in gluten-free options, many people have found that they no longer have to miss out on enjoying craft beer. Many brewers have recognized the desire for gluten-free customers to enjoy their beer without the concern of ingesting gluten, leading many craft brewers to utilize alternative grains during the brewing process that do not contain gluten. Dedicated gluten-free breweries have also found success catering to people dealing with gluten intolerance as well as health-minded beer drinkers who choose to follow a gluten-reduced or gluten-free diet, but don\u2019t want to give up their favorite beverage. Barley, wheat, oats, rye and spelt are the ingredients that most breweries use to brew the beers that the world has come to love. These ingredients commonly contain gluten, so people who suffer from celiac disease must look for other fermentables to be featured in gluten-free beer. Many craft breweries who make gluten-free beers have turned to malted sorghum and buckwheat, which are grains that do not contain gluten to brew beers for their gluten-averse customers. People have dealt with the effects of celiac disease since the mid-1800s, but the grains responsible for the condition weren\u2019t discovered until the 1940s. Brewers began brewing craft beers in the United States in the mid-1960s, and that path has eventually led to the creation of gluten-free craft beers. Several craft brewers across the United States have brewed reduced-gluten and gluten-free craft beers so that everyone of age can be a part of the craft beer community. Even with the progress the craft beer community has made toward including the gluten-free community, gluten-free beer can still be a difficult thing to find at times. As a solution to this, we\u2019ve created an interactive \u201cFind a Brewery\u201d map to help you find breweries and brewpubs, and some of those craft breweries do serve gluten-free beers. Our map allows you to enter your specific location, search for a particular brewery, or search for a brewery by state. We want to do our part to keep the craft beer community as tight as we can and helping you find new places to try the craft beers that you love is a large part of that. Finding your next favorite gluten-free craft beer doesn\u2019t have to stop here.

            "DESC": "American craft beer lovers are huge fans of the IPA. The quest for more of the India pale ale flavor has led them to the imperial India pale ale, a stronger version of the American IPA, which boasts even more hoppy flavor, aroma and bitterness. Imperial India pale ale is darker in color than the American IPA, substantially more bitter, and high in alcohol by volume. This all-American take on the IPA leaves craft beer fans with plenty of new creations to try. The imperial India pale ale features high hop bitterness, flavor and aroma. Hop character is fresh and evident from the utilization of any variety of hops. Alcohol content is medium-high to high and notably evident with a medium-high to full body. This style intends to exhibit the fresh, evident character of hops. Craft beer has grown because of the curiosity that American craft brewers have exhibited through their tweaking of classic beer recipes. The love for the American IPA flavor that craft beer consumers have shown has led American craft brewers to the imperial IPA. The imperial IPA beer style creeps towards some of the strongest of ales in alcohol content, but the increase in hops from the original IPA beer recipe gives it a more bitter taste and doesn\u2019t bring the same malt taste that barley wine does. For fans of the original India pale ale flavor, the imperial IPA is the perfect craft beer for you to explore. It can be challenging to keep up with all the breweries that serve their own variations of the India pale ale. To help you keep up with all of the breweries and brewpubs that make up the craft beer scene, we have created an interactive \u201cFind a Brewery\u201d map to help you do precisely that. By entering your precise location, searching by state, or searching for a specific brewery, you\u2019ll be able to discover craft breweries near you, and many are likely to brew variations of India pale ales.

If you love American craft beer, the Irish red ale beer remains a great style for beer lovers to seek out and appreciate. The Irish-style red ale is a balanced beer that uses a moderate amount of kilned malts and roasted barley in the recipe, which gives the beer the color for which it is named. Featuring an approachable hop bitterness which rests on the palate, this typically amber-colored beer is brewed as a lager or an ale, and can often have a medium, candy-like caramel malt sweetness. This style may contain adjuncts such as corn, rice, and sugar, which help dry out the beer\u2019s finish and lessen the body. It also often contains roasted barley, lending low roasted notes, darker color and possible creation of a tan collar of foam on top. With notes of caramel, toffee and sometimes low-level diacetyl (butter), think of the Irish red ale beer style as a cousin to lightly-toasted and buttered bread. Irish-style red ales are an approachable style for people who are new to craft beer, but are also enjoyed and appreciated by even the most discerning of craft connoisseurs. Don\u2019t let these tasty, sessionable beers be relegated to a once-a-year holiday, Irish style reds can be enjoyed throughout the year in a variety of occasions and with a lot of different food options. It\u2019s no secret that Irish beers have played an influential role in the American craft beer scene, and that\u2019s apparent through the Irish red ale beer. It can be challenging to keep up with all of the Irish beer reinventions, and that is why we\u2019ve created an interactive \u201cFind a Brewery\u201d map.

It\u2019s tough to find anything that hasn\u2019t been \u201cpumpkin spiced,\u201d and beers are no different. Pumpkin flavored beers have caught the attention of craft beer and pumpkin lovers everywhere, partially because the flavors can be implemented in several beer styles. Whether you\u2019re interested in trying pumpkin amber ales, IPAs or pumpkin stouts, there are plenty of options from American craft brewers for you to explore. Perhaps the most seasonal of seasonal beers, the pumpkin beer style can be brewed with pumpkin, just pumpkin spices, or even winter squash. Since the fruit does not have much of a taste by itself, many craft brewers have taken to adding spices typically found in pumpkin pie, like cinnamon and clove. However, these flavors should not overpower the beer. Pumpkin can be found in everything from stouts to pale ales and pilsners. Pumpkin spice beer is so versatile that it is hard to nail down its particular characteristics. Pumpkin flavored beers can range from relatively light to dark, bitter or malt forward, and can be either sessionable or strong as far as the alcohol content is considered. As you\u2019d expect, the pumpkin beer style pairs well with fall food flavors like roasted turkey and coffee ice cream. Camembert cheese is another decadent beer pairing if you\u2019re pouring a glass of pumpkin flavored beer to enjoy. Pumpkin spice beers are a very popular seasonal beer style for a reason. American craft breweries everywhere likely have their own version of pumpkin beer you can explore, so get out and try them this fall (sometimes breweries even release them in late summer). If you are a lover of pumpkin ale, we can help you find a craft brewery that might serve one you haven\u2019t tried yet. Finding your next favorite pumpkin flavored beer doesn\u2019t have to stop here.
